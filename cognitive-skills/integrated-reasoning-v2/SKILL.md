# Integrated Reasoning v2 - Meta-Orchestration

**Purpose**: Select and orchestrate optimal reasoning pattern(s) for your problem. V2 addresses limitations of v1: adds new patterns, replaces order-dependent decision tree with weighted scoring, includes feedback loops, and fixes confidence aggregation.

## Available Reasoning Patterns (9)

| Pattern | Purpose | Best For |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)** | Find optimal solution through deep exploration | Optimization, clear criteria, find THE best |
| **Breadth of Thought (BoT)** | Map solution space comprehensively | Unknown space, need multiple options |
| **Self-Reflecting Chain (SRC)** | Sequential reasoning with validation | Dependent steps, proofs, linear traces |
| **Hypothesis-Elimination (HE)** | Systematic elimination through evidence | Diagnosis, debugging, root cause |
| **Adversarial Reasoning (AR)** | Stress-test through attack simulation | Validation, security, pre-mortems |
| **Dialectical Reasoning (DR)** | Synthesize opposing valid perspectives | Trade-offs, conceptual conflicts |
| **Analogical Transfer (AT)** | Solve via cross-domain parallels | Novel problems, no direct precedent |
| **Rapid Triage Reasoning (RTR)** | Fast decisions under time pressure | Incidents, emergencies, time-boxed choices |
| **Negotiated Decision Framework (NDF)** | Multi-stakeholder coordination | Politics, competing interests, buy-in needed |

---

## Pattern Selection: Weighted Multi-Dimensional Scoring

### Step 1: Assess Problem Characteristics

Score each dimension (1-5):

```markdown
| Dimension | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Sequential Dependencies** | _/5 | Do steps depend on previous steps? |
| **Criteria Clarity** | _/5 | Can you clearly evaluate solutions? |
| **Solution Space Known** | _/5 | Do you know the options? |
| **Single Answer Needed** | _/5 | Need ONE answer vs multiple options? |
| **Evidence Available** | _/5 | Can you gather discriminating evidence? |
| **Opposing Valid Views** | _/5 | Are there legitimate conflicting perspectives? |
| **Problem Novelty** | _/5 | Is this unprecedented in your domain? |
| **Robustness Required** | _/5 | Need to stress-test before committing? |
| **Solution Exists** | _/5 | Do you have a candidate solution to evaluate? |
| **Time Pressure** | _/5 | How constrained is decision time? (5=minutes) |
| **Stakeholder Complexity** | _/5 | Multiple parties with competing interests? |
```

### Step 1.5: Time Pressure Fast-Path

**CRITICAL**: If Time Pressure = 5 (emergency/incident):
- Skip full scoring
- Use **Rapid Triage Reasoning (RTR)** directly
- RTR is optimized for decisions under extreme time constraints

If Time Pressure ≥ 4:
- Consider RTR unless problem is clearly sequential (use SRC) or diagnostic (use HE)
- Apply abbreviated scoring (skip orchestration considerations)

### Step 2: Calculate Pattern Affinity Scores

```
ToT  = (Criteria × 0.35) + (SingleAnswer × 0.30) + (SpaceKnown × 0.20) + ((6-Novelty) × 0.15)

BoT  = ((6-SpaceKnown) × 0.35) + ((6-SingleAnswer) × 0.30) + ((6-Criteria) × 0.20) + (Novelty × 0.15)

SRC  = (Sequential × 0.45) + (Criteria × 0.25) + (SingleAnswer × 0.20) + ((6-OpposingViews) × 0.10)

HE   = (Evidence × 0.40) + (SingleAnswer × 0.30) + ((6-Novelty) × 0.20) + ((6-OpposingViews) × 0.10)

AR   = (Robustness × 0.40) + (SolutionExists × 0.30) + ((6-Novelty) × 0.15) + (Evidence × 0.15)
       # NOTE: AR requires SolutionExists ≥ 3, otherwise score = 0

DR   = (OpposingViews × 0.50) + (Criteria × 0.20) + ((6-Evidence) × 0.15) + (MIN(SingleAnswer, OpposingViews) × 0.15)
       # NOTE: V2.1 fix - SingleAnswer no longer penalized when OpposingViews is high

AT   = (Novelty × 0.45) + ((6-SpaceKnown) × 0.30) + ((6-Evidence) × 0.15) + ((6-Sequential) × 0.10)

RTR  = (TimePressure × 0.50) + (SingleAnswer × 0.25) + (Evidence × 0.15) + ((6-Novelty) × 0.10)
       # NOTE: RTR auto-selected when TimePressure = 5

NDF  = (StakeholderComplexity × 0.45) + (OpposingViews × 0.25) + ((6-Criteria) × 0.15) + ((6-TimePressure) × 0.15)
       # NOTE: NDF requires StakeholderComplexity ≥ 3 to be considered
```

**Formula Validation Rules** (V2.1):
- AR returns 0 if SolutionExists < 3 (nothing to attack)
- RTR auto-triggers when TimePressure = 5 (emergency mode)
- NDF returns 0 if StakeholderComplexity < 3 (single decision-maker)
- If multiple patterns score within 0.3 of each other, use uncertainty propagation (Step 2.5)

### Step 2.5: Uncertainty Propagation (V2.1)

When dimension scores are uncertain, propagate uncertainty to pattern selection:

```markdown
## Uncertainty Assessment

For each dimension where you're unsure (±1 point uncertainty):

1. Calculate pattern scores at LOW end (dimension - 1)
2. Calculate pattern scores at HIGH end (dimension + 1)
3. If different pattern wins at each end → **Flag as uncertain selection**

### Handling Uncertain Selections

**If same pattern wins both ends**: Proceed with confidence
**If different patterns win**:
  - Run BOTH patterns in parallel (if time permits)
  - OR use the pattern that's more robust to being wrong
  - OR gather more information to reduce dimension uncertainty

### Uncertainty Discount
Apply -5% to final confidence for each uncertain dimension that affects the winning pattern.
```

### Step 3: Interpret Scores

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| One pattern scores >4.0 | Use that pattern directly |
| Top 2 within 0.5 of each other | Consider multi-pattern orchestration |
| Top 3 within 0.3 of each other | Apply uncertainty propagation first |
| All patterns <3.0 | Problem may need decomposition first |
| Top pattern <2.5 | None fit well; use Direct Analysis |

---

## Multi-Pattern Orchestration

### When to Orchestrate

- Top 2 patterns within 0.5 points AND
- Problem is high-stakes (consequences matter) AND
- Time budget allows (>45 minutes available)

### Orchestration Patterns

**Sequential Orchestration** (most common):
1. Use exploration pattern first (BoT, AT)
2. Use optimization pattern second (ToT, HE)
3. Use validation pattern last (AR, SRC)

**Parallel Orchestration** (when patterns are complementary):
- Run 2 patterns independently
- Compare conclusions
- Use agreement/disagreement to calibrate confidence

**Nested Orchestration** (when patterns address different aspects):
- Apply different patterns to different sub-problems
- Synthesize at the end

### Orchestration Decision Table

| Pattern A High | Pattern B High | Orchestration |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| BoT | ToT | Sequential: BoT (explore) → ToT (optimize top options) |
| BoT | HE | Sequential: BoT (generate hypotheses) → HE (eliminate) |
| ToT | AR | Sequential: ToT (select) → AR (validate before commit) |
| ToT | SRC | Sequential: ToT (decide) → SRC (plan implementation) |
| DR | ToT | Sequential: DR (resolve tension) → ToT (optimize within synthesis) |
| AT | ToT | Sequential: AT (find analogies) → ToT (evaluate derived solutions) |
| AT | BoT | Parallel: Both explore, merge findings |
| HE | SRC | Sequential: HE (find cause) → SRC (trace mechanism) |
| RTR | HE | Sequential: RTR (immediate triage) → HE (post-incident RCA) |
| RTR | AR | Sequential: RTR (quick decision) → AR (post-decision validation) |

| NDF | ToT | Sequential: NDF (get buy-in) → ToT (optimize within agreed bounds) |
| NDF | DR | Sequential: DR (resolve conceptual tension) → NDF (negotiate stakeholders) |
| BoT | NDF | Sequential: BoT (explore options) → NDF (negotiate which to pursue) |

**RTR Orchestration Rules**:
- RTR is typically a STARTING pattern, not an ending one
- After RTR stabilizes situation, follow up with deeper analysis
- RTR → HE for incident root cause analysis
- RTR → ToT for revisiting decision with more time

**NDF Orchestration Rules**:
- NDF typically FOLLOWS technical analysis (know options before negotiating)
- BoT → NDF: Explore space, then negotiate which options to pursue
- NDF → ToT: After stakeholder agreement, optimize implementation
- DR → NDF: Resolve conceptual tensions first, then stakeholder tensions

## Parallel Execution Integration

### When to Parallelize

Parallel execution is appropriate when independent reasoning paths can run concurrently without blocking each other:

| Condition | Parallelization Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Top 2 patterns within 0.3 of each other** | Run both patterns in parallel, compare results |
| **BoT natural parallelism** | 8-10 branches can explore simultaneously |
| **Hypothesis testing (HE)** | Parallel evidence gathering for multiple hypotheses |
| **Multi-perspective needs (MoA pattern)** | Different "expert personas" analyze in parallel |

### Parallel Orchestration Patterns

| Pattern Combination | Parallel Strategy | Merge Approach |
|--------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **BoT \|\| AT** | Parallel exploration from different angles | Merge findings, deduplicate insights |
| **ToT branches** | Parallel subtree exploration at each level | Take best-scoring subtree |
| **HE hypotheses** | Parallel evidence collection for each hypothesis | Aggregate evidence, eliminate losers |
| **AR attacks** | Parallel threat simulation (different attack vectors) | Union of discovered vulnerabilities |

### Parallel Configuration

```yaml
parallel_config:
  max_concurrent_patterns: 3      # Max patterns running simultaneously
  max_concurrent_branches: 8      # Max branches within a single pattern
  merge_strategy: "consensus"     # "consensus" | "voting" | "aggregation" | "best-of-n"
  timeout_per_branch_ms: 60000    # 60 second timeout per branch
  early_termination_threshold: 0.95  # Stop early if confidence exceeds this
```

**Configuration Guidelines**:
- Use `max_concurrent_patterns: 2` for typical orchestration
- Use `max_concurrent_branches: 8` for BoT exploration
- Increase `timeout_per_branch_ms` for complex sub-problems
- Lower `early_termination_threshold` (e.g., 0.85) when speed matters more than certainty

### Merge Strategies

| Strategy | When to Use | Behavior |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Consensus** | High-stakes, need confidence | All must agree → boost confidence by +10%; any disagreement → flag for review |
| **Voting** | Multiple viable options | Majority wins; ties broken by highest individual confidence |
| **Aggregation** | Complementary findings | Synthesize all findings into unified result; no filtering |
| **Best-of-N** | Competitive exploration | Take highest confidence result; discard others |

**Merge Strategy Selection**:
```
If robustness critical → "consensus"
If options are mutually exclusive → "voting"
If findings are additive → "aggregation"
If racing for speed → "best-of-n"
```

### Integration with .reasoning/ Protocol

Parallel execution integrates with the `.reasoning/` handover protocol:

```
.reasoning/
├── current-context.md         # Master context (shared by all branches)
├── parallel-session/
│   ├── config.yaml            # Parallel execution configuration
│   ├── branch-001/
│   │   ├── approach.md        # Pattern being applied
│   │   ├── findings.md        # Intermediate findings
│   │   └── confidence.json    # Branch confidence score
│   ├── branch-002/
│   │   ├── approach.md
│   │   ├── findings.md
│   │   └── confidence.json
│   └── branch-N/
│       └── ...
├── merge-result.md            # Synthesized output from all branches
└── handover.md                # Final handover (captures all branch insights)
```

**Protocol Rules**:
1. Each parallel branch writes to its own `branch-{id}/` directory
2. Branches read shared context but do NOT write to shared files
3. Merge phase reads all branches, applies merge strategy
4. Handover document captures insights from ALL branches (not just winner)
5. Failed branches are preserved for debugging (marked with `status: failed`)

**Branch Handover Template**:
```markdown
## Branch {id} Summary
- **Pattern Applied**: [pattern name]
- **Conclusion**: [finding]
- **Confidence**: [X]%
- **Key Insights**: [unique contributions]
- **Disagreements**: [where this branch diverged from others]
```

## Feedback Loop: 15-Minute Checkpoint

**After 15 minutes of applying selected pattern:**

```markdown
## Checkpoint Evaluation

### Progress Check
- [ ] Have I made meaningful progress toward goal?
- [ ] Is my confidence increasing?

### Pattern Fit Check
- [ ] Am I fighting the methodology?
- [ ] Have I discovered new problem characteristics?

### New Information
- [ ] Has the problem changed?
- [ ] Do my characteristic scores need updating?

### Decision
If 2+ checks FAIL:
  → PAUSE: Re-score characteristics
  → If different pattern scores highest: SWITCH
  → If same pattern: Continue with awareness

If all checks PASS:
  → Continue current pattern
  → Set next checkpoint at 30 min mark
```

---

## Confidence Aggregation (Fixed)

**V1 Problem**: Additive confidence boosting was statistically invalid.

**V2 Approach**: Agreement-based bounded adjustment.

### Single Pattern Confidence
Use the pattern's internal confidence score (per its methodology).

### Multi-Pattern Confidence

```markdown
## Multi-Pattern Synthesis

### Raw Scores
- Pattern A conclusion: [Answer A] at [X]% confidence
- Pattern B conclusion: [Answer B] at [Y]% confidence
- Pattern C conclusion: [Answer C] at [Z]% (if used)

### Agreement Analysis

**FULL AGREEMENT** (same conclusion):
- Final Confidence = MAX(X, Y, Z) + 5%
- Cap at 95%
- Rationale: Independent paths converging increases trust

**PARTIAL AGREEMENT** (2/3 agree):
- Final Confidence = (AVG of agreeing × 0.7) + (disagreeing × 0.15)
- Must document the disagreement
- Consider: Why does one pattern disagree?

**NO AGREEMENT** (different conclusions):
- Final Confidence = MIN(X, Y, Z) - 10%
- This is a FEATURE not a bug - disagreement reveals complexity
- Action: Either (a) gather more information, or (b) present trade-offs to stakeholder

### Shared Assumption Discount
If patterns share significant assumptions, apply -5% adjustment.
(Same LLM, same problem framing, same information = shared blind spots)
```

## Pattern Limitations Reference

**Tree of Thoughts (ToT)**:
- Requires clear evaluation criteria
- Deep recursion may overfit to evaluation function
- Fixed branching can force artificial distinctions

**Breadth of Thought (BoT)**:
- Cannot truly be "exhaustive"
- 8-10 branches may not cover solution space
- Returns multiple options requiring further decision

**Self-Reflecting Chain (SRC)**:
- Limited by weakest step in chain
- Backtracking is costly
- Assumes linear dependency structure

**Hypothesis-Elimination (HE)**:
- Requires discriminating evidence
- Can only find causes in the hypothesis set
- Time-sensitive (may not suit exploration)

**Adversarial Reasoning (AR)**:
- Requires existing solution to attack
- Can be demoralizing if overused
- May miss non-adversarial failure modes

**Dialectical Reasoning (DR)**:
- Requires genuinely opposing valid views
- Synthesis isn't always possible
- Can be slower than just deciding

**Analogical Transfer (AT)**:
- Analogy quality varies widely
- Source domain may mislead
- Requires creativity in finding parallels

**Rapid Triage Reasoning (RTR)**:
- Sacrifices depth for speed
- May miss optimal solution (accepts "good enough")
- Requires follow-up analysis for important decisions
- Not suitable when time is actually available

**Negotiated Decision Framework (NDF)**:
- Requires multiple genuine stakeholders
- Time-intensive (relationship building takes time)
- May produce suboptimal technical solutions for political acceptance
- Doesn't help when one party has absolute authority

## Example Application

**Problem**: "Design our company's approach to AI governance"

### Characteristic Scoring
| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Sequential Dependencies | 2 | Not really step-by-step |
| Criteria Clarity | 3 | Some criteria, but subjective |
| Solution Space Known | 2 | Emerging field, options unclear |
| Single Answer Needed | 4 | Need one policy |
| Evidence Available | 2 | Few precedents to learn from |
| Opposing Valid Views | 5 | Big tension: innovation vs caution |
| Problem Novelty | 5 | Very new challenge |
| Robustness Required | 4 | High stakes, need validation |
| Solution Exists | 1 | No candidate solution yet |
| Time Pressure | 2 | Strategic decision, not urgent |

### Pattern Affinity Scores
- ToT: (3×.35)+(4×.30)+(2×.20)+(1×.15) = 2.80
- BoT: (4×.35)+(2×.30)+(3×.20)+(5×.15) = 3.35
- SRC: (2×.45)+(3×.25)+(4×.20)+(1×.10) = 2.55
- HE: (2×.40)+(4×.30)+(1×.20)+(1×.10) = 2.30
- AR: **0** (SolutionExists=1 < 3, nothing to attack yet)
- DR: (5×.50)+(3×.20)+(4×.15)+(4×.15) = 4.30
- **AT: (5×.45)+(4×.30)+(4×.15)+(4×.10) = 4.45** ← Highest
- RTR: (2×.50)+(4×.25)+(2×.15)+(1×.10) = 2.40

### Recommendation
**Primary**: Analogical Transfer (4.45) - Look at how other governance challenges were solved
**Secondary**: Dialectical Reasoning (3.80) - Innovation vs caution tension needs synthesis

**Orchestration**: AT → DR → AR
1. Use AT to find analogous governance frameworks (environmental, financial, medical)
2. Use DR to synthesize the innovation/caution tension
3. Use AR to stress-test the proposed governance approach
