# Negotiated Decision Framework (NDF)

**Purpose**: Navigate multi-stakeholder decisions where different parties have legitimate but competing interests. NDF helps find decisions that stakeholders can live with, even if no one gets everything they want.

## When to Use NDF

**Use NDF when:**
- Multiple stakeholders must agree (or at least not block)
- Different parties have different success criteria
- Power dynamics or politics affect the decision
- Past decisions created winners/losers who remember
- "Best technical answer" won't get adopted due to stakeholder resistance
- Need buy-in for implementation success

**Don't use NDF when:**
- Single decision-maker with clear authority (use ToT)
- Stakeholders agree on criteria (use ToT with shared criteria)
- Conceptual tension, not stakeholder tension (use DR)
- Time pressure prevents negotiation (use RTR, negotiate later)

**NDF vs Other Patterns:**
- DR: Resolves conceptual/philosophical tensions (NDF: resolves people tensions)
- ToT: Finds optimal given criteria (NDF: finds optimal given stakeholders)
- BoT: Explores solution space (NDF: explores stakeholder space)

## Core Methodology: ALIGN Framework

### A - Analyze Stakeholder Landscape

**Goal**: Map who matters and what they care about

**Process:**
1. Identify all stakeholders (not just vocal ones)
2. Assess their power and interest
3. Understand their underlying interests (not just stated positions)
4. Map relationships and alliances

**Stakeholder Mapping Template:**
```markdown
## Stakeholder Analysis

### Power-Interest Grid

|           | Low Interest | High Interest |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **High Power** | Keep Satisfied | Key Players |
| **Low Power** | Monitor | Keep Informed |

### Stakeholder Profiles

#### [Stakeholder 1]
- **Role**: [Title/Function]
- **Power Level**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Interest Level**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Stated Position**: [What they say they want]
- **Underlying Interest**: [Why they want it - the deeper need]
- **Success Criteria**: [How they'll judge the decision]
- **Potential Blockers**: [What would make them oppose]
- **Potential Sweeteners**: [What would win their support]
- **Relationships**: [Allies, conflicts with other stakeholders]

#### [Stakeholder 2]
...
```

**Interest Archeology:**
Don't just accept stated positions. Dig deeper:
- "We need feature X" → Why? What problem does X solve?
- "This must be done by Q2" → Why? What happens if Q3?
- "We can't change the database" → Why? What's the actual constraint?

### L - Locate Zones of Agreement

**Goal**: Find common ground before addressing differences

**Process:**
1. Identify shared goals (even if approaches differ)
2. Find overlapping interests
3. Establish agreed constraints
4. Build on areas of alignment

**Agreement Mapping:**
```markdown
## Zones of Agreement

### Shared Goals
- [Goal that all stakeholders want]
- [Another shared goal]

### Overlapping Interests
| Interest | Stakeholders Who Share |
|----------|------------------------|
| [Interest 1] | A, B, C |
| [Interest 2] | A, D |
| [Interest 3] | B, C, D |

### Agreed Constraints
- [Constraint everyone accepts]
- [Another constraint]

### Foundation Statement
"We all agree that [shared goal], within [constraints],
and we all want [overlapping interest]."
```

**Use agreement zones to:**
- Frame discussions positively
- Remind stakeholders of shared purpose when tensions rise
- Build solutions that honor common ground first

---

### I - Identify Irreducible Conflicts

**Goal**: Understand where genuine conflicts exist (not all conflicts are real)

**Conflict Classification:**

| Type | Description | Resolution Approach |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **False Conflict** | Misunderstanding, same goal different words | Clarify, reframe |
| **Resource Conflict** | Competing for same limited resource | Expand pie, prioritize, take turns |
| **Value Conflict** | Different fundamental values | Acknowledge, find higher-order value |
| **Interest Conflict** | Different parties want different outcomes | Trade, compromise, or escalate |
| **Relational Conflict** | History/politics, not the actual issue | Address relationship separately |

**Conflict Analysis Template:**
```markdown
## Conflict Analysis

### Conflict 1: [Name]
- **Parties**: [Stakeholder A] vs [Stakeholder B]
- **Type**: [False/Resource/Value/Interest/Relational]
- **A's Position**: [What A wants]
- **B's Position**: [What B wants]
- **Underlying Interests**:
  - A really needs: [Deeper interest]
  - B really needs: [Deeper interest]
- **Compatible?**: [Can both interests be met?]
- **Resolution Path**: [How to address]
```

**Key Insight**: Many conflicts are about HOW, not WHAT. If underlying interests are compatible, the conflict is solvable.

### G - Generate Integrative Options

**Goal**: Create solutions that satisfy multiple stakeholders' interests

**Integrative Strategies:**

1. **Expand the Pie**: Find resources to satisfy everyone
   - "Can we get more budget/time/people?"
   - "Can we do both sequentially instead of choosing?"

2. **Trade Across Issues**: Give on low-priority, get on high-priority
   - "You care more about X, we care more about Y - swap?"
   - "We'll accept your timeline if you accept our approach"

3. **Add Issues**: Bring in new elements to enable trades
   - "What if we also addressed Z, which you care about?"
   - "Can we package this with the other decision?"

4. **Compensate**: Make up for losses elsewhere
   - "You lose on this, but gain on that"
   - "This time your priority, next time ours"

5. **Reframe**: Find higher-order framing everyone can support
   - "We all want customer success - here's how this achieves it"
   - "This isn't A vs B, it's achieving C"

**Option Generation Template:**
```markdown
## Integrative Options

### Option 1: [Name]
- **How it works**: [Description]
- **Satisfies [Stakeholder A]**: [How it meets their interest]
- **Satisfies [Stakeholder B]**: [How it meets their interest]
- **Trade-offs**: [What each party gives up]
- **Feasibility**: [Can we actually do this?]

### Option 2: [Name]
...

### Comparison Matrix
| Option | Stakeholder A | Stakeholder B | Stakeholder C | Feasibility |
|--------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Opt 1  | [Score 1-5]   | [Score 1-5]   | [Score 1-5]   | [High/Med/Low] |
| Opt 2  | [Score 1-5]   | [Score 1-5]   | [Score 1-5]   | [High/Med/Low] |
```

### N - Negotiate Commitment

**Goal**: Move from options to agreement with genuine buy-in

**Negotiation Principles:**

1. **BATNA Awareness**: Know each party's Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement
   - If their BATNA is better than your offer, they won't agree
   - Improve your offer or worsen their BATNA (ethically)

2. **Commitment Levels**: Not all agreement is equal
   - **Comply**: Will do it if required (weak)
   - **Accept**: Can live with it (moderate)
   - **Endorse**: Will support it (strong)
   - **Champion**: Will advocate for it (strongest)

3. **Legitimate Process**: Stakeholders accept outcomes better when process felt fair
   - Were they heard? Were their interests considered?
   - Is the decision-making process transparent?

**Commitment Template:**
```markdown
## Negotiated Agreement

### Decision Summary
[The agreed decision in clear terms]

### Stakeholder Commitments
| Stakeholder | Commitment Level | What They Get | What They Give |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| A | [Comply/Accept/Endorse/Champion] | [Their gain] | [Their concession] |
| B | [Comply/Accept/Endorse/Champion] | [Their gain] | [Their concession] |

### Conditions and Contingencies
- [Condition 1]: If [X], then [Y]
- [Review point]: Revisit at [date/milestone]

### Dispute Resolution
If disagreement arises: [How to handle]

## Power Dynamics Navigation

**When Power is Unequal:**

| Situation | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| You have low power | Build coalition, appeal to higher values, make strong case |
| You have high power | Use power sparingly, seek genuine input, explain reasoning |
| Power is unclear | Clarify decision rights before negotiating |
| Power is contested | Escalate to clarify, or negotiate decision process first |

**Political Patterns to Watch:**

1. **End-Run**: Stakeholder goes around you to higher authority
   - Prevention: Keep sponsors informed, address concerns early

2. **Pocket Veto**: Stakeholder agrees but doesn't implement
   - Prevention: Explicit commitment, visible milestones

3. **Relitigating**: Stakeholder reopens "settled" decisions
   - Prevention: Clear closure process, document agreements

4. **Coalition Building**: Stakeholders ally against you
   - Response: Build your own coalition, address their concerns

## Special Scenarios

### Scenario: Consensus Required but Not Achievable

When true consensus isn't possible:

1. **Consent-based**: "Can everyone live with this?" (not "Does everyone love it?")
2. **Disagree and Commit**: Document disagreement, commit to decision
3. **Conditional Agreement**: "I'll support this if [condition]"
4. **Escalation**: Transparent escalation to decision-maker with recommendation

### Scenario: Hidden Agendas

When you suspect unstated interests:

1. Ask "What would success look like for you?"
2. Observe what they fight for vs. what they say
3. Consider their incentives and pressures
4. Test hypotheses about real interests

### Scenario: Past Wounds

When history poisons current negotiation:

1. Acknowledge the history explicitly
2. Separate the people from the problem
3. Focus on future, not past blame
4. Consider symbolic gestures of recognition

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Assuming Single Decision-Maker**: Not recognizing stakeholder complexity
   - Fix: Always do stakeholder analysis first

2. **Positional Bargaining**: Arguing positions instead of interests
   - Fix: Ask "Why?" five times to find real interest

3. **Ignoring Relationship**: Focusing only on this decision
   - Fix: Consider ongoing relationship, not just this transaction

4. **Winner-Take-All**: Trying to maximize one party's outcome
   - Fix: Seek integrative solutions that create value for all

5. **Premature Commitment**: Locking in before exploring options
   - Fix: Generate options before evaluating them

6. **Ignoring Implementation**: Agreement that can't be executed
   - Fix: Include implementers in negotiation, test feasibility

---

## Integration with Other Patterns

**Before NDF:**
- BoT: Explore full solution space before stakeholder negotiation
- DR: Resolve conceptual tensions first, then negotiate

**After NDF:**
- ToT: Optimize implementation details within agreed framework
- AR: Stress-test agreed solution before full commitment

**Parallel with NDF:**
- RTR: If time pressure, do quick stakeholder check, negotiate later
- SRC: Trace implementation steps after agreement reached
